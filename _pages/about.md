Hi there! My name is Zhicheng Wang, you can just call me William or Willa (if you choose to go with female pronouns).

I'm a PhD student from Robotics & Machine Intelligence Lab, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Qiuguo Zhu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0011353). Curently I am working as a research assistant at [Institute of Infocomm Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/home)(I2R), [A-STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore.

My major research interests are legged robotics and locomotion, artificial intelligence and motion planning. I hope to replicate human and other creatures' abilities on robots on the future.  

I'm planning to write down some of my research experiences into blogs, but haven't started yet.
