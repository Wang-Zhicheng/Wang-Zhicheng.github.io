### SOOT Morph Investigator

Intersection project. Introduce CV into atmospheric particle identification. Built an automatic program for batch processing electro-microscope images.

Period: Oct 2019 - Jan 2020

[paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JD036055)

### Pretrained Model for Bounding Gait

My first DeepRL project. Extract reflections from data trajectories to boost RL optimization.

Period: Dec 2019 - Aug 2020

[paper](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/csy2.12062)


### Hybrid Bipedal Locomotion

DRL with humanoid locomotion. Tried to reduce NN policy's stress by combining Raibert's controller.

Period: Feb 2022 - Aug 2022

[paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/13/10/1688)


### Learned Humanoid Locomotion

Trying to train robust locomotion policies with DRL

Period: Jan 2021 - 


### Minimal Learned Quadrupedal Locomotion

First project during A*STAR attachment.

Built a minimal RaiSim training environment that produces robust trotting policies that can work on real robots.

Aiming to provide a baseline for following privilege training implementations.

Period: Jul 2022 - Aug 2022

### Regularized RMA

An improved implementation of [RMA](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/13/10/1688)

Beside reappearing the teacher-student privilege training schedule, added specialized gait reward with inspiration from [Peroidic Reward]() and control commands.

Training curriculum is also modified into a simpler version.

Trained trotting, bounding, galloping and fall recovery policies.

Period: Oct 2022 - Jan 2023

### SDK development for Wukong-IV humanoid

Wukong-IV is a  humanoid robot designed and made by Robotics & Machine Intelligence Lab of Zhejiang University.
It is 1.4 m tall, weighs 45 kg, and is actuated by 21 electric motor joints.
The SDK was formalized in this project, as the preparation for subsequent developments.

Period: Aug 2023 - Oct 2023

### Learned Robust Humanoid Locomotion

A humanoid implementation based on [DreamWaQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10602)

Trained robust walking policies that can traverse stairs, slopes and outdoor terrains.
The policy also can endure kicking.
